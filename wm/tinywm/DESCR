TinyWM is a tiny window manager created as an exercise in minimalism. It is
also maybe helpful in learning some of the very basics of creating a window

It lets you do four basic things:

- Move windows interactively with Alt+Button1 drag
- Resize windows interactively with Alt+Button3 drag
- Raise windows with Alt+F1
- Focus windows with the mouse pointer
