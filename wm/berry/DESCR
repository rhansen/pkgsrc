berry is a healthy, bite-sized window manager written in C for unix systems.

Its main features include:

* Controlled via a powerful command-line client, allowing users to control
windows via a hotkey daemon such as sxhkd or expand functionality via shell
scripts.
* Small, hackable source code.
* Extensible themeing options with double borders, title bars, and window text.
* Intuitively place new windows in unoccupied spaces.
* Virtual desktops.
